        Tools: Android Studio - Firebase

Feel free to try it and give me feedback 


Note 1: Don't enter important data such as the password because I didn't use the Authentication feature of firebase
      So ur data is unprotected( I didn't want to use the feature cause I needed to be aware of passwords because I forget the passwords I set ü§ê)Ÿí 
Note 2: Please do not post inappropriate photos if you logged in and want to add products (doing this is useless and hurtful to me)
I didn't want to put a limit on membership like roles for the buyer and roles for the seller to make you try the program comfortably


Note 3: the Final version with 89% Firebase Performance in Last Branch 5 , Soon will be more Update also so don't forget to check branches
